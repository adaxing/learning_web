jQuery
	- one of the many libraries for JavaScript
	- design to simplify scripting done on the client side
		easily manipulate elements, create animations and handle input events
	- dollar sign syntax ($)
	- often selects an HTML element with a selector($), then do something to that element
	- script in the beginning
		<script>
			$(document).ready(function(){

			}) // important!!, because without it, when it run before html rendered, it will get in bug
		</script>

	- when selecting three ways
		class -> $(".class").function
		id -> $("#id").function
		element -> $("element").function
	- jquery function
		.addClass() = add new classes // can add multiple classes in a single call
		.removeClass() = remove classes
		.css("","") =  change CSS of element
		.prop() = allow to adjust properties of elements 						ex:.prop('disabled',true)
		.html() = allow to add HTML tags and text within an element, any 		content within element will be completely replaced
		.text() = only change text within an element, without adding tags
		.remove() = remove an HTML element entirely
		.appendTo() = select HTML elements and append to another element
		.clone() = make a copy of element
			.clone().appendTo("") -> select element and make a copy and append to another place, without remove element from original place
		.parent() = allow to access the parent of whichever selected element 
		.children() = allow to access children of whichever selected children
		:nth-child(n) = allow to select all the nth elements with the target 	class or element type 
		:odd/even = select even/odd elements, selection starts from 0

HTML
	<em>vs.<i>
	both italicize text
	- visual result is same
	- but! <em> works on stress emphasis
			<i> works on refer to something


Sass(Synatactically Awesome StyleSheet)
	- extension of CSS, since it is preprocessor -> takes code
